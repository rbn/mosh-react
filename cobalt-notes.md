- routing is hacked - need to figure out login
- routing - repeating "main" and "aside" too much
  - either add global styles or figure out useOutletContext
- refresh does not appear to be working (go to API demo, click around, click refresh)
- form labels - heading etc - custom styles (see "Registration Options")
